## Conway's game of life
- Create a function `printGrid`, that takes a 2d array of booleans as an argument and prints that array using '`.`' for `false` and '`#`' for true
- Create a function `randomizeGrid`, that takes a 2d array of booleans as an input, and then for every cell randomly assigns `true` or `false` value
- Create a function `howManyNeighbors` that takes as arguments: 2d array of booleans, integer x and integer y and returns a single integer value - number of neighbors of cell `x,y` with `true` value. As neighbors we count nearest horizontal, vertical and diagonal cells.
  - IMPORTANT! To correctly handle edge cases use Periodic Boundary Conditions. 
- Create a function `nextCellState` that takes an integer `n` and boolean `state` as arguments and produces a boolean output according to the following rules:
  - if `state` is `true` and `n` is 2 or 3, then `true`, otherwise `false`
  - if `state` is `false` and `n` is 3, then `true`, otherwise `false`
- Create a function `nextGrid`, that takes 2d boolean array as an argument and produces new 2d boolean array as an output. This new 2d array should be generated by calling `nextCellState` for every cell in the original array. As the input for this function use `howManyNeighbors` function
- Create function `runSimulation`, that takes no arguments and produces no output. In this function create a randomized 2d array of booleans (use `randomizeGrid`), then in an infinite `while` loop:
  - generate next grid using `nextGrid` function
  - print grid using `printGrid` function
